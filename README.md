# Overview

I wanted to learn a bit about React Native syntax and what not, so I did this little project that is a Travel Planning App. This App is pretty basic, you open it up to a home page with a welcome message and then there is a button you can click that will take you to a popup form that allows you to fill in detailed about your trip. Some of the categories you can add more that one item to, such as activities you can add multiple, and remove them as well if you added too many. Then once you click submit the form will save your info to a formatted pdf and download it to you phone.

# Development Environment

I used React Native and Expo for this app. I also used react native community packages such as @react-native-community/datetimepicker, expo-print, and expo-file-system.

# Useful Websites

* [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/)
* [Educative](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-make-forms-in-react-native)

# Future Work

* Currently the file is saved to a weird place on my phone, I would like it to be saved to a more simple location.
* Add a database to store the itineraries instead of saving to a file.
* have the program calculate to cost of your trip.
